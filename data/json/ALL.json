Diethylene glycol is toxic because it is converted to oxalic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase [dee-HY-druh-juh-nays] and other enzymes, which damages the kidneys and brain. If given early enough, ethanol is a treatment for this poisoning. Which of the following reasons is the most likely explanation for why ethanol is an effective treatment?",
